description: Keep Markdown content in next/content and static assets in next/public with predictable paths

# Content location (Markdown/MDX)
- Store all site content in `next/content/**` (e.g., posts, poems, talks, hydras, lives).
- Do not scatter Markdown/MDX outside `next/content/**`.
- When adding new sections, create a folder under `next/content/SECTION_NAME`.

# Static assets (images, gifs, icons, files)
- Place all static assets under `next/public/**`.
- Reference assets with absolute paths (e.g., `/images/...`) rather than relative filesystem paths.
- Prefer `next/image` where applicable for image optimization; fall back to `<img>` when necessary.

# Hotlinking
- Avoid hotlinking for persistent assets (images/gifs used in content or UI). Copy them into `next/public/**`.

# Organization conventions
- Use `next/public/images/SECTION/...` for section-specific assets (e.g., `parvagues`, `hydras`, `lives`, `posts`).
- Keep large/rarely used files out of git history when possible (use external storage/CDN), but link them in content.

# Build/deploy stability
- Do not fetch remote static assets at build time for core UI; ensure assets are present in `next/public/**`.
- Keep filenames stable to avoid cache-busting issues unless intentionally versioning assets.
