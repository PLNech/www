title: "Search Relevance in the Gen AI Age"
description: " You’re just done tuning search relevance perfectly for your human users, and just when you think you’re done, now you must do it again for robots? This is the age of RAG: we return relevant search results, not to a user, but to a LLM. What does this change? Can I reuse what I already know about relevance? You’ll learn that relevance for LLMs is not far from relevance for human users, and most of your hard work can be reused!"
