# Hosting the Paradiso Discord Bot for Free

This guide explains how to host your Paradiso Discord bot for free using Replit, ensuring it runs 24/7 without any costs.

## What is Replit?

[Replit](https://replit.com) is a browser-based IDE that allows you to write, run, and host code in the cloud. It's perfect for hosting Discord bots because:

1. It offers a free tier with no credit card required
2. It can keep your bot running 24/7 (with some setup)
3. It's easy to use and doesn't require server management

## Step 1: Create a Replit Account

1. Go to [Replit](https://replit.com)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Verify your email address

## Step 2: Create a New Repl

1. Click the "+ Create" button
2. Select "Python" as the template
3. Name your repl "ParadisoBot" or something similar
4. Click "Create Repl"

## Step 3: Set Up Your Bot Files

1. Upload the `paradiso_bot.py` file to your Repl
2. Create a new file called `keep_alive.py` with the following code:

```python
from flask import Flask
from threading import Thread

app = Flask('')

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return "Paradiso Bot is alive!"

def run():
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=8080)

def keep_alive():
    t = Thread(target=run)
    t.start()
```

3. Modify the end of your `paradiso_bot.py` file to use the keep_alive function:

```python
# At the top of the file, add:
from keep_alive import keep_alive

# At the bottom of your file, replace:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    client.run(DISCORD_TOKEN)

# With:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    keep_alive()  # Keep the bot alive
    client.run(DISCORD_TOKEN)
```

## Step 4: Set Up Environment Variables

Replit provides a secure way to store sensitive information like API keys.

1. In your Repl, click on the ðŸ”’ icon in the sidebar (or find "Secrets" in the "Tools" menu)
2. Add the following secrets:
   - Key: `DISCORD_TOKEN`, Value: `your-discord-bot-token`
   - Key: `ALGOLIA_APP_ID`, Value: `your-algolia-app-id`
   - Key: `ALGOLIA_API_KEY`, Value: `your-algolia-api-key`
   - Key: `ALGOLIA_MOVIES_INDEX`, Value: `paradiso_movies`
   - Key: `ALGOLIA_VOTES_INDEX`, Value: `paradiso_votes`
   - Key: `OMDB_API_KEY`, Value: `your-omdb-api-key`

## Step 5: Install Dependencies

1. Create a new file called `pyproject.toml` with the following content:

```toml
[tool.poetry]
name = "paradiso-bot"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "Discord bot for Paradiso movie night voting"
authors = ["Your Name <your.email@example.com>"]

[tool.poetry.dependencies]
python = "^3.8"
discord = "^2.0.0"
python-dotenv = "^0.21.0"
algoliasearch = "^2.6.2"
requests = "^2.28.1"
Flask = "^2.2.2"

[build-system]
requires = ["poetry-core>=1.0.0"]
build-backend = "poetry.core.masonry.api"
```

2. Replit will automatically install the dependencies when you run the bot

## Step 6: Run Your Bot

1. Click the "Run" button at the top of the page
2. Your bot should start up and connect to Discord
3. You'll see a webview showing "Paradiso Bot is alive!"

## Step 7: Keep Your Bot Running 24/7

By default, Replit will stop your bot after some time of inactivity. To keep it running:

1. Go to [UptimeRobot](https://uptimerobot.com/)
2. Create a free account
3. Click "Add New Monitor"
4. Select "HTTP(s)" as the monitor type
5. Enter a friendly name like "Paradiso Bot"
6. Enter the URL of your Repl webview (e.g., `https://paradisobot.yourusername.repl.co`)
7. Set the monitoring interval to 5 minutes
8. Click "Create Monitor"

UptimeRobot will now ping your bot every 5 minutes, keeping it alive 24/7.

## Step 8: Update Your Bot

To update your bot when you make changes:

1. Make changes to the files in your Repl
2. Click the "Stop" button if your bot is running
3. Click the "Run" button to restart your bot with the changes

## Alternative Free Hosting Options

## Troubleshooting

- **Bot crashes or doesn't respond**: Check the console output in Replit for error messages
